![](heyRoomie1.gif)

An app to help you assess, maintain, and assign dorm rooms.  This can help your team:

<!-- - Check each room for maintenance issues and assessing for size (can 2 people fit in here?), -->
<!-- - Report any maintenance issues with the room, -->
<!-- - Record key codes for each room, -->
- Assign participants to a room(s) for the duration of their stay,
<!-- - Print a list of rooms needing linens by day, -->
<!-- - Print a list of rooms needing furniture changes (beds raised/lowered, items borrowed from another room and when/where to return them), -->
<!-- - Record what key code they have been given, and how they have paid their key deposit (if applicable), -->
<!-- - Record any internal information about their stay (locks self out every night, left a mess, etc.), -->
- List which rooms are unassigned each night, so that last minute arrivals can be managed,
- List which participants remain unassigned, and show their room preferences and your own notes about them,
<!-- - Display a calendar of arrivals/departures, -->
- Submit nightly occupancy reports via email.
