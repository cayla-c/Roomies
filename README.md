# Roomies

An app to help you assess, maintain, and assign dorm rooms.  This can help your team:

- Check each room for maintenance issues and assessing for size (can 2 people fit in here?),
- Report any issues with the room,
- List which rooms are unassigned each night, so that last minute arrivals can be managed,
- Submit nightly occupancy reports via email.

There is a landing page with buttons taking you to different generic tasks (“Generate occupancy report”, “Find empty rooms”, etc).
“View floors” takes you to a certain dorm and floorplan, with clickable rooms.  Each room has the option of reporting maintenance, showing size, and who is supposed to be in it each night of the festival.   A user can:
  - Select a typical answer (“AC is out”) or enter a custom comment (“furniture MIA”) for room maintenance,
  - Assign a participant to put in that room from a dropdown.
  - Already assigned participants might be greyed out, or italicized - you CAN select them, if they are requesting a change, and they will be MOVED to that room, and their previous room becomes available.
